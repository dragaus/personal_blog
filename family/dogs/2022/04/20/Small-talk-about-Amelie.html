    <h1>Small talk about amelie</h1>

<p>tags: dogs love smalltalk english </p>

<p>This is my first post written in English. I don’t know if I will continue writing in English, I just know that this one I will.</p>

<p>This is a simple blog entry, I’m really worried about my syntaxis, cause I’m not an english native speaker I just hope this could be understandable.</p>

<p>I will talk a little about my oldest dog, she’s a beautiful female dog named Amelie, she’s kind of old. I mean for a dog, she is about 14 years old, I really love her.</p>

<p>She loves to run or she used to, now she just can walk fast, she has a couple of accidents in her life which made me really worried at those times, in one of those she felt out of the second floor and unfortunately she lost one of her teeth, the other one she get in a fight with a bigger dog than she and got her back injured, fortunately she recover quite fast for both of those accidents.</p>

<p>I just really hope she stays with us as much as she can.</p>
